## Bachelors Thesis: "Estimation of Non-Stationary, Linear, Time Series"

The paper and presentation included in this portfolio are the culmination of twelve months of research undertaken with the supervision of Prof. Bernard Hanzon. I began a position as a Research Assistant to Prof. Hanzon and later that year was invited to continue this project as my Bachelors thesis of the B.Sc Financial Math and Actuarial Science in University College Cork. 

The motivation for this work stems back to Prof. Hanzons work in State Space Systems with Gaussian error process and their properties under non-stationary conditions. In the simplified case of linear ARMA models, we explored maximum likelihood estimation and developed approximation techniques for purely explosive and mixed root processes. We did this by transforming ARMA process to infinite AR form and estimating the truncated series. We refered to this as an AR(p*) approximation. 

I designed experiments to investigate the convergence and consistency properties of this method for AR and MA coefficient estimates and with respect to hyperparameters. I formulated hypothesis for convergence and consistency based on the findings.
